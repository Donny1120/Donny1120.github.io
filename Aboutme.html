	 <p><b>This is a about my life and how I enjoy living it.</b> I got to school everyday until I gradute in 2023. I go to Bronx Early College Academy which is close to Yankee Stadium. While I live a normal life in school, afterschool my life is really busy. For example a normal day for me is not easy for everyone since i'm putting in hard work every chance I get. After school I have to go home as soon as possible if I don't have to do anything outside or go anywhere. </p>

<p><i>I get home I changed and get ready to go to the gym to work out for a full 2 to 3 hours almost everyday.</i> During my workout I work every part of my body on different days. After my workout I got to the park to do my second workout which is based off ecuadorian volleyball. Basically working on my skills and helping myself get better without anybody to help me out. Then after that I go home to eat or hang out with freinds then go to bed. </p>

  <p>Now when it hits the weekends it is very different when it comes to my day. I wake up and go to workout in the park for only an hour. Then come back and then get ready to go out with my family for a bit. After that I go out to either any place in New York City, the state, P.A, CT, or New Jersey to go play ecuadorian volleyball. After every time I play I come out mainly winning and earning money for my hardwork. </p>
