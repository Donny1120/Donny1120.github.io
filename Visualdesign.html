<p><h1> Mandala Flower:</h1></p>

<p> I made this project by using the shoes in Photoshop and rotating them constantly to make patterns. First I chose the shape I wanted, which was a flower. After I duplicated the pages and made the image smaller and changed the color and centered it then rotated it and combined it. Lastly I repeated the steps until I made a spiral. I used a beautiful flower and the colors I used were dark blue and light green. What I notice happen is the shapes kept duplicating and shifting the shapes everywhere. &nbsp; </p>
<p><h1>Filters & Adjustments Transformation:</h1></p>

<p> We made this project by using photoshop and turning a picture into a really creative artwork. First what I did was choose an image that I preferred. Then edit it by rotating it to make it look like a pattern. After that, combine it to make it look like a repeated pattern on it and it goes from a simple image to looks like a unique pattern as a rug/mat. The original photo was making copies and rotating them and adding them together to make this unique pattern.</p>
<p><h1>Pixel Character:</h1></p>

<p>I used the tools by coloring them differently to make a specific character when zoomed out. I started byt making the character first before the background which is the third mario brother. My character looks like a darker version of the Mario Bros but a whole set of different features. My character is wearing a plumber's hat that is blue with a blue t-shirt and gray overalls and white gloves. My character would be another version of Mario but where he is the hero saving his brothers from Bowser. The purpose would be to complete every level and get steps closer to save his brothers.
